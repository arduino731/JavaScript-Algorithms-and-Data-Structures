Summary of JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (DSA)
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental concepts in programming that help optimize code efficiency and problem-solving. In JavaScript, DSA is widely used in areas like web development, backend programming, and competitive coding.

1. Data Structures in JavaScript
Data structures organize and store data efficiently. Common ones include:

Arrays – Ordered lists that store elements sequentially (push(), pop(), map(), filter(), etc.).
Linked Lists – A collection of nodes, where each node points to the next (singly, doubly, circular).
Stacks – Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure (push(), pop()).
Queues – First In, First Out (FIFO) structure (enqueue(), dequeue()).
Hash Tables (Objects & Maps) – Key-value pairs for fast lookup (Map(), Set()).
Trees – Hierarchical structures like Binary Search Trees (BST).
Graphs – Nodes connected by edges, useful in networking and pathfinding.
2. Algorithms in JavaScript
Algorithms are step-by-step methods to solve problems efficiently. Common types include:

Sorting Algorithms:

Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort (basic, slower)
Merge Sort, Quick Sort (faster, divide & conquer)
Searching Algorithms:

Linear Search – Check each element one by one (O(n))
Binary Search – Divide and conquer, works on sorted arrays (O(log n))
Recursion:

A function calling itself to solve smaller problems (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci).
Graph Algorithms:

Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS).
Dynamic Programming:

Optimizing recursive problems by storing past results (e.g., Fibonacci, Knapsack problem).
Greedy Algorithms:

Solving problems by choosing the best option at each step (e.g., Dijkstra’s algorithm).
3. Why Learn DSA in JavaScript?
