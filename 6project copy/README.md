ðŸ§° Project Overview: Training a Sign Language Model
Tool Used: Teachable Machine
A beginner-friendly tool that makes training machine learning models easy and accessible.

Simple interface with webcam support

Allows you to train a model using your own hand gesture images or videos

Exports the trained model for use in web-based projects (e.g., with ml5.js and p5.js)

ðŸ§  How I Trained the Sign Language Model
Step 1: Define the recognition goal
I focused on recognizing single-hand gestures, such as letters from the ASL alphabet (e.g., "A", "B", "C").

Step 2: Collect training data
Using Teachable Machine, I recorded gesture examples directly through the webcam, and also uploaded my own video clips to enhance the dataset.

Step 3: Train and export the model
After training the model, I exported it and integrated it into a JavaScript project using ml5.js and p5.js.
