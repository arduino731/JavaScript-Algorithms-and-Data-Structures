# JavaScript Select Menu: Changing Background with Switch and DOM Manipulation

###### Summary for this project 
I have built a functionality using vanilla JavaScript that allows selecting three options with a function to change the background. It uses a `````switch````` statement and handles the `selectedIndex`, dealing with `-1` when no option is selected. The `selectedIndex` property will return `-1` if no option is chosen. Additionally, I use the `setAttribute` method to modify the `href` attribute of an HTML `<head>` element to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) with JavaScript.
